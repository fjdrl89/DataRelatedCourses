# 1. Data Basics

Something we should first consider when starting to work with data is what data types we have: structured vs. unstructured, quantitative vs. qualitative. 

- **Unstructured data**, like a football match video, appears without labels or order.
  - Unstructured data, like highlight videos, interviews, or product pictures, is harder to analyze directly but can offer rich insights when processed.
- **Structured data**, like a table listing goals, times, and players, is organized and easier to analyze. Neither is better - it depends on our needs.
  - Structured data, common in spreadsheets, is easy to filter and analyze. Examples include sales records, employee attendance, or weather data.

- Quantitative data, or "numerical data", involves numbers, like points scored, height, or temperature, which is ideal for calculations and visualizations.
- Qualitative data, or "categorical data", describes things grouped into categories, like favorite sports or customer feedback, useful for spotting patterns.

# 2. Data Wisdom

- Mental models give us a framework to understand the world around us and uncover the relationships hidden within the vast data landscape. 
- Enter the Data, information, knowledge and wisdom pyramid. This pyramid, more commonly known as DIKW, highlights the journey data takes in order to become valuable wisdom. Each step of the pyramid requires refining the level below to extract more and more meaning until we finally achieve wisdom. Lets take a deeper look at each section of the pyramid.

- Data forms the base of the DIKW Pyramid.
- Data can be comprised of many different things. Words, numbers, dates, images, or even sounds. On its own, data isn't very useful.
- Taking the raw data and adding some context we can begin to understand more what the data means and transform it into information.
- Adding context revealed a whole new level of the pyramid and turned our raw data into information.
- **Information** on its own isn't enough to make decisions. Instead, we need to tie these pieces of information together in order to understand their relationship. These links or connections between the different pieces of information is what allows us to add more meaning and transform our information into **knowledge**.
- Transforming knowledge into **wisdom** is arguably the hardest of the entire pyramid. There are many strategies for achieving this and going heavily into detail could easily be its own course.
- From a very high level, transforming **knowledge** into **wisdom** requires us to add more meaning to the information at hand and understand the relationships between each piece of information.
- This final level of meaning allows us to make decisions and apply our knowledge the world around us. We have achieved wisdom.

- Decision making is simply the process we all undergo to make the right choices at the right time. For many decisions, employing data can help make a tough choice clearer.
- Data-driven decision making is a five-step process, each step revealing more to ultimately drive a well informed decision. The process begins with asking a question, gathering the correct data, preparing the data, conducting analysis, and finally making the right decision. It is important to note that this process is repeating in nature. As we make decisions, the results of those decisions can fuel future decision making.

- The journey of a data-driven process starts with identifying the question you are looking to answer. This may sound easy, but it is the hardest part of the entire data-driven decision making process. A good question, will make it clear what you are trying to answer and prevent you from creeping into other areas. Taking a little extra time to clearly define your question will ensure your success through the rest of the process.
- With your focused question in mind, the search begins for the right data to answer this question. Data can often live in multiple locations and in multiple forms so being deliberate with where you source data is important. Thinking ahead to your analysis can also payoff greatly. For example, if you are deciding between two different versions of your data, one in its raw form and one summarized by month, knowing which is most valuable for your analysis can reduce the amount of cleaning and prep you need to do in the next step.
- Preparing data can mean many things. In some instances it is converting messy or low quality data into higher quality data through skillful manipulations. In others it is simply arranging the data into whatever expected format you need it in to enable your analysis. Many types of analysis have very specific requirements for how data should be arranged and aligned. A cleaned dataset will be ready for analysis without any additional effort or outstanding concerns. In some cases the data preparation phase can be the most cumbersome taking up to 80% of the overall time for the entire decision making process.
- Analyzing data is next. This step is critical because it is what transforms our data into something we can make decisions with. Data analysis tools like Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Google Sheets allow us to perform many different kinds of analysis to find insights from data. The technical detail of these tools is outside the scope of this course. I recommend checking other DataCamp courses for a thorough understanding of these tools and techniques.
- The final step is ultimately interpreting the results and making a decision. Armed with our analysis we will be able to balance the outcome with our knowledge of broader subject matter to arrive at a data-driven decision. It is vital to recognize that the outcome of the analysis is only part of being data-driven, our personal experiences and knowledge also help drive the decision making and blending these two together we can arrive at a decision that is much more powerful than making it with gut feeling alone. This whole process is also iterative in nature. As you make decisions and observe their outcome you are better equipped to make changes and improvements to your decision making process.
