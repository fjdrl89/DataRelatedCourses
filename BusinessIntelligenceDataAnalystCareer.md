# Business Intelligence Data Analyst Career Path

## Path Overview and Introduction to Data

- Tools in the Data Scientist Career Path:
  * Data Literacy
  * Data extraction with SQL
  * Programming basics with Python
  * Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Python
  * Data analysis using pandas, a Python library
  * Data visualization using Matplotlib, a Python library
  * Experimental Design and Hypothesis Testing

- Data can mean a lot of things, but within data science, it typically means a collection of organized observations.
- There are two types of organization: methodology and shape:
  * The methodology is how the data was collected. We will get more into that later in this lesson.
  * The most common shape for data is a spreadsheet or table. The things we are measuring (variables) are in the columns, and the individual instances (observations) are in the rows. We can read each column “down” the table (viewing multiple observations), and each row “across” the table (viewing multiple variables).

- In a well-organized dataset, the variables describe a characteristic of our entities. However, it can be surprisingly difficult to define good variables. Good variables measure only one characteristic and should not be a characteristic themselves.

- The difference between measuring and categorizing is so important that the data itself is termed differently:
  * Variables that are measured are Numerical variables
  * Variables that are categorized are Categorical variables.

- Numerical variables are a combination of the measurement and the unit. Without the unit, a numerical variable is just a number.
- There are two ways to get a number: by counting and measuring. Counting gives us whole numbers and discrete variables. Measuring gives us potentially partial values and continuous variables.
- Categorical variables describe characteristics with words or relative values.
- Ordinal variables can get a little confusing because they are often represented as numbers. But they don’t represent measurements or counts, they represent categories.
- It’s not just typos, mistakes, missing data, poor measurement, and duplicated observations that make a dataset low quality. We also have to make sure that our data actually measures what we think it is measuring. This is the validity of our dataset.
- Validity is a special kind of quality measure because it’s not just about the dataset, it’s about the relationship between the dataset and its purpose. A dataset can be valid for one question and invalid for another.
- The goal of a sample is to represent a population. Any time a sample is made that does NOT reflect the entire population, it is a sampling error.
- Best practice is to create a sample that represents the entire population.
- The sample should look like the population in as many characteristics as possible.
