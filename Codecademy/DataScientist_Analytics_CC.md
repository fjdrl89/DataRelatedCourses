# Welcome to the Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist Career Path

This Career Path is divided into 2 parts:
- The first section covers all the basics every Data Scientist needs. We call this the Foundations of Data Science.
- The second section is the specialized KSAs you need to go from being a data generalist to an Analytics-based Data Scientist.

In the first half of this Career Path, you will learn about Python, SQL, statistics, and data best practices. You will start with a code-free introduction to working with data in the Data Literacy Track and then dive into SQL and Python in the SQL Fundamentals and Python Fundamentals Tracks. SQL and Python are essential tools that will give you the technical foundation you need to work with data programmatically.

Then you will dive into Data Manipulation with Python Pandas. Pandas is a Python library at the heart of Data Science. It is an essential tool for working with data and has dozens of useful built-in functions. Once you have mastered Pandas, you will apply your new programming skills to Exploratory Data Analysis where you will learn to summarize datasets before mastering the Fundamentals of Statistics where you will learn to spot trends and patterns.

Next, you will learn how to transform those numbers and analyses into meaningful Data Visualizations. Then you will apply your new skills to Wrangle and Tidy Datasets and prepare real data for analysis. Finally, you will bring it all together to Communicate Data Science Findings to various groups and stakeholders.

In the Analytics Specialty, you will learn the most practical tools and techniques to get meaning from data. You’ll use data responsibly to drive decision-making, and give evidence for and against various hypotheses. You’ll supplement your programming skills by developing proficiency in BI Tools such as Excel and Tableau.

By the end of the Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist Career Path, you will be able to:

- Create programs with Python 3
-Query and manipulate data with SQL and Python pandas
- Create data visualizations with Python matplotlib and seaborn
- Summarize and analyze datasets
- Conduct hypothesis testing
- Design experiments
- Clean and tidy datasets
- Use statistical methods to evaluate large and small datasets
- Answer business questions with data
- Build dashboards to tell a data story with Tableau
- Use advanced SQL techniques to analyze data efficiently and communicate your findings
- Decide when to use BI Tools vs. programming tools to solve problems and answer questions
- Leverage Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and communication

Along the way, you will build a portfolio of projects to showcase your data science KSA’s, and prove your job-ready skills!
